Patterns:
 Patterns in Java are a common programming exercise involving the creation of specific shapes or
 sequences of characters using loops.
  They serve as a valuable practice for understanding control
 structures and enhancing problem-solving skills.

 In this repository we will learn:
 --> square patterns
 --> triangle patterns 
 --> pyramid patterns

Before printing any pattern, you must consider the following three things:
 ● The first step in printing any pattern is to figure out the number of rows that the pattern
 requires.
 ● Next, you should know how many columns are there in the i’th row.
 ● Once you have figured out the number of rows and columns, then focus on the pattern to
 print.
